## Business Insights

### 1. Premium Concentration Risk
- Travel and Health policies generate the highest premium volume.
- Heavy dependence on limited policy types increases segment-level risk exposure.

### 2. Policy Portfolio Health
- Only about 58% of policies are active.
- A 42% inactive rate suggests issues in renewals, retention strategy, or product fit.

### 3. Claims Rejection Pattern
- Rejected claims exceed settled claims.
- Indicates potential gaps in customer onboarding, coverage clarity, or documentation quality.

### 4. Claim Value by Age Group
- Adults contribute the highest claim value, followed by elders.
- Younger segments show lower claim exposure, highlighting uneven risk distribution.

### 5. Operational Bottlenecks
- Pending claims hold a significant monetary value.
